# Smartmockups project

Project contains two versions of same app.

First version that is located in folder **spa** using my own *(stripped)* devstack

Second version, located in folder **nextjs** was created with intention to rewamp of how Next.js works. Project using same components as previous version with small edits to better support this library. It is basically a copy of SPA with additional `next.js` features.

Used techs:
- react
- redux
- typescript
- webpack
- styled-components
- prettier
- eslint
- jest

*I was thinking about creating small monorepo to be able to reuse same components for both versions, but at the end i decided that it is a bit overkill*
